This directory contains the most up-to-date version of the Feedreader Testing suite

Overview
--------
Test-driven development is a great way to approach development. Instead of just rushing in to code, we build a series of tests that stress our desired functionality. As we build, tests will go from pass to fail and when all the tests pass, we should have a working version of our desired product.

In this exercise, I was given an existing Feedreader application and my job was to use the Jasmine library to design tests that would make sure that
-RSS Feeds were defined, had a url and had a name
-The Menu was hidden by default and was visible when clicked
-Initial entries could be loaded
-Feeds would change their content when new content was loaded

In addition, to go beyond the bare minimum for the assignment, I was asked to build an additional test of my own choosing. For that, I made a test to make sure that the page loaded quickly.
